# The Frontend Architect Role

## Overview

The role of a frontend architect is not universally defined, but modern architects share common responsibilities and traits. Unlike traditional "ivory tower" architects who worked in isolation, modern architects are embedded within development teams.

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Setting Technical Direction

- Creating and maintaining technical vision and strategy
- Making architectural decisions
- Writing and reviewing code
- Speaking on behalf of the company's technologies
- Ensuring team alignment on technical direction

### 2. Applying Architectural Thinking

- Understanding and analyzing tradeoffs
- Translating business drivers into architectural requirements
- Maintaining both technical breadth and depth
- Making informed architectural decisions

### 3. Performing "Glue Work"

- Writing documentation
- Running meetings
- Providing mentorship and sponsorship
- Growing the team
- Sharing architectural knowledge
- Facilitating team collaboration

## The Knowledge Pyramid

### Three Levels of Knowledge

1. **Top Level (Technical Depth)**

   - Areas of expertise (e.g., React, JavaScript)
   - Deep, specialized knowledge

2. **Middle Level (Technical Breadth)**

   - Surface-level understanding
   - Areas of basic familiarity
   - Things "we know we don't know"

3. **Bottom Level**
   - Unknown unknowns
   - Areas requiring exploration

## Important Traits

### Technical Balance

- Maintain expertise in core technologies
- Expand knowledge beyond comfort zone
- Understand related technologies (servers, databases, etc.)
- Balance depth with breadth

### Leadership Qualities

- Ability to make and communicate decisions
- Mentorship and team growth
- Documentation and knowledge sharing
- Cross-team collaboration

## Key Insights

1. **Title vs. Role**

   - The architect role can exist without the title
   - Responsibilities can be part of other roles (Tech Lead, Team Lead)
   - Focus on the work, not the title

2. **Shared Responsibility**
   - Architecture is everyone's responsibility
   - All team members can contribute to architectural decisions
   - Collective ownership of system quality
